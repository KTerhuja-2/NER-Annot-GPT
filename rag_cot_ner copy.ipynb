    "The microscopic examination revealed a typical LCH.\n",
    "The tumor cells had vesicular and grooved nuclei, and they formed small aggregations around the bronchioles (Fig.1).\n",

    "He quit smoking, but he received no other specific treatment.\n",
    "He was well for the following one year.\n",
